# 🤔 How to run on your pc?

**It's simple, you just need to have docker and coker-compose installed on your machine**
- 1️⃣ If you have it, just download the dockerConfigs folder and docker-compose.yaml file.
- 2️⃣ Then run on your terminal:
  
  ```
  docker-compose up
  ```

With this, all the application, frontend, backend, and mysql database, with pré-data will be created.

# Access frontend application
To access the application, you will need to access on your browser:

```
https://localhost:3000/
```

# Access backend
To acces the backend in your browser or apps like postman, you have to acces the follow URL:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/Products
```

This is for access the URL to see all the products, but you can change 'Products' to 'Categories' ou other endpoint that you can see on C# source code folder
